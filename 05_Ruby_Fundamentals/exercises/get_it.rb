#1 - Pull the json from the reddit API via http://www.reddit.com/.json
  # - http://mashable.com/stories.json (homework)
#2 - Parse it using the JSON library
#3 - Find the stories based on techniques used in the code_along (max of 25 provided)
#4 - Create a new story hash out of each story with the following keys :title, :upvotes and :category
    #title, #category and #upvotes may not be the names use
#5 - Add each story to an array
#6 - Print each story from the array on your "Front Page"
#7 - BONUS ### create an 'csv' file using the api data & Ruby's CSV library
     # -> http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.2/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html
         #title, upvote, category are the required columns
